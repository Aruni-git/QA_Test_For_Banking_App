Banking App QA test cases
Version 1

This test cases were created as part of the banking app I created for the QA assignment. To run the API please download/clone this https://github.com/Aruni-git/banking-app.git and then run the banking app as a python project. To run the API tests written in java, banking app API should be up and running in localhost.
 
For the Mock / service virtualization of banking app I have used The Ready API (you can find more details here https://support.smartbear.com/readyapi/docs/). I have created the function test suite and automated one non-functional test case using this tool and all test data and generated report from load api is linked with this GitHub repository https://github.com/Aruni-git/BankingAsignment_ReadyAPI.git.

Please note that I am using a trial version of Ready A~~~~PI, hence for the load testing maximum user count that I can use is 25.
